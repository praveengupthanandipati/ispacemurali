                <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
                    iSpace is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains data collection and
                    use practices of the iSpace.com site (the “Site”); it does not apply to other online or offline
                    iSpace sites, products or services. By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information
                    collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.</p>
                <p>Related services and offerings with links from this web site, including partner sites, have their own
                    privacy statements which can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding links within each respective
                    web site.</p>
                <p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br />
                    We will explicitly ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal
                    information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you
                    have requested such as receiving information about iSpace products and services, ordering e-mail
                    newsletters, joining a limited-access site or service, signing up for an event or training, or when
                    downloading and/or registering iSpace products. The personal information we collect may include your
                    name, title, company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address,
                    information about your job function, and information about your company.</p>
                <p>The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service
                    provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and
                    time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of
                    the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve
                    the site, analyze trends and administer the site. Our sites may at times also collect information
                    about your hardware and software in order to provide a requested service.</p>
                <p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br />
                    The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the
                    service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.</p>
                <p>In support of these uses, iSpace may use personal information to provide you with more effective
                    customer service, to improve the Site and any related iSpace products or services, and to make the
                    Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by
                    customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests. In order to offer you a more
                    consistent experience in your interactions with iSpace, information collected by iSpace.com may be
                    combined with information collected by other iSpace services.</p>
                <p>We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or
                    service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your
                    permission, we may send you information about other iSpace products and services, and/or share
                    information with iSpace partners so they may send you information about their products and services.

                    products, special offers, and other services. We will only provide those companies the personal
                    information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of
                    the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>

                    served on iSpace or the Site; (b.) – Protect and defend the rights or property of iSpace and our
                    family of Web sites; or (c.) – Act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of iSpace
                    employees or agents, users of iSpace products or services, or members of the public.</p>

                    using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>

                    make choices about how you wish to be contacted.<br />
                    Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site will not
                    necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to iSpace in the context of other,

                    part of the service(s) you have chosen.</p>

                    security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized
                    access, use, or disclosure. Additionally, when we transmit any sensitive personal information (such

                <p><strong>Protection of Children’s Personal Information</strong></p>

                    children.</p>
                <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br />
                    We use may use cookies on this Site to personalize user experiences. A cookie is a small text file
                    that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
                    deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a
                    Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
                <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For
                    example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall
                    your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant
                    content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you
                    previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site’s features that you customized.
                </p>
                <p>We may occasionally opt to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but do not allow
                    other companies to place cookies on our sites unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value
                    (such as merging into iSpace.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).
                </p>
                <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
                    but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
                    decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other
                    Web sites you visit.</p>
                <p><strong>Use of Web Beacons</strong><br />
                    iSpace.com Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called
                    single-pixel gifs – that allow iSpace.com to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver
                    co-branded services. iSpace.com may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or
                    newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
                <p>Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the
                    effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by
                    these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the service
                    provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile
                    anonymous information in relation to those page views. iSpace.com prohibits Web beacons from being
                    used to collect or access your personal information.</p>
