                    <p>ClaimShark is a secure cloud-based solution that breaks down silos, aligns activities and brings
                        oversight to the entire Payment Integrity effort. It empowers the Health Plan Payment Integrity
                        stakeholders by giving them real time information and visibility to the life cycle of a claim
                        from the time it is touched by a vendor all the way to collections and recovery.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>ClaimShark</p>
                    <p>is built on a hub and spoke model with the hub being the Health Plan and the spokes being the
                        internal audit team and the different vendors that are contracted to recover over payments.
                        Internal teams and vendors can be engaged based on criteria like lag, plan type, geographic
                        allocation, dollar value, recovery type (concepts) and claim</p>

                                <p>With robust dynamic dashboards that can be customized, Health Plans and vendors get a
                                    detailed real time update on the life cycle of the claim, type of recovery by volume
                                    and value, plan vs. actual, vendor, provider and more</p>
                                <p><b>Dynamic workflow:</b></p>
                                <p>Health Plan and vendor can setup their individual workflow queues to manage internal
                                    routing and reporting</p>
                                <p><b>Productivity: </b></p>
                                <p>Vendors get detailed visibility to the productivity of their auditors and collection
                                    agents. Vendor details are rolled up, so Health Plans get a comprehensive view of
                                    recoveries by vendors, return on investment and value generated.</p>

                                    With every claim tracked from identification to recovery, the Health Plan can track
                                    and predict recoveries by month, quarter and year. With details on the claims by
                                    different statuses, recoveries can be accelerated to meet any quarterly financial
                                    shortfalls</p>
                                <p><b>Provider Abrasion:</b> Payment Integrity efforts have a direct impact on NPS and
                                    Provider grievances. With a consolidated data by claim and provider, the Health Plan
                                    can get reports on which providers are contacted multiple times and preempt any
                                    complaints or grievances. The Payment Integrity efforts can be turned up or down to
                                    minimize Provider noise.</p>
                                <p><b>Analytics: </b>With a robust Datawarehouse and detailed activity log, advanced
                                    analytics can help bring transparency and visibility to the Payment Integrity
                                    efforts.</p>
